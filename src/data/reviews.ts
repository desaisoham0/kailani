The service is great as well—everyone is so nice, and the establishment is very clean and cute! I think it’s great for an affordable date spot, too!",

    text: "had a wonderful experience at this Ramen restaurant, where the ambiance was clean and organized, and the Hawaii shave ice was notably colorful and beautiful. The K-Ramen offered a pleasing level of spice, though the Tonkotsu Ramen was slightly too salty for my taste. However, the Shoyu Ramen was the highlight, with its perfectly balanced flavors standing out as the best dish. Overall, this restaurant impressed me with its authentic flavors and presentation, making it a must-visit spot.",

The vibe was so positive, the staff were so sweet and friendly and accommodating, and the food was amazing. I was also happy I could get a vegetarian option ramen with gf (rice) noodles because most ramen places don’t make those accommodations. I also got the strawberry shortcake shaved ice and it was so, so good. Go and support an amazing small business. We’ll definitely be coming back for many more trips to come 🏝️ 🍜 🍨 🫠✨",
